# 🧠 Employee Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on employee feedback using a test dataset. The goal is to classify feedback as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. All work was done on **Google Colab** using Python and common NLP libraries.

## 📂 Dataset
- Simulated/test dataset with employee comments and sentiment labels.
- Used for demonstration and experimentation purposes.

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF)
- Model training (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Google Colab  
- NLTK / Scikit-learn / Pandas / Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab, upload the dataset (if needed), and run each cell to see results and sentiment predictions.

## ✅ Output
Achieved good classification performance on the test data. Sample predictions demonstrate correct identification of sentiment.

## 📌 Note
This project is for educational purposes only and uses a sample dataset.
